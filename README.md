# SSH Tunnel System

Self-hosted SSH tunnel system (Serveo alternative) for accessing servers behind NAT.

## Features

- **SSH Reverse Tunnels**: Access servers behind NAT via SSH
- **Auto-reconnection**: Clients automatically reconnect on connection loss
- **CLI Management**: Simple command-line interface for tunnel management
- **Secure**: TLS encryption and SSH key authentication
- **Lightweight**: Single binary deployment, minimal resource usage
- **Self-hosted**: Full control over your tunnel infrastructure
